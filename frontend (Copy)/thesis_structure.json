          "content": "In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the amount of digital data \cite{Reinsel2018} generated across scientific, industrial and societal fields. Historically, hardware scaling trends enabled sustained improvements in hardware performance and density; however, as data generation continues to grow exponentially, these improvements are becoming less sufficient to resolve the increasing mismatch between data growth and hardware evolution. As a consequence, storing large amounts of digital data over a long period of time is becoming increasingly challenging. Traditional data storage technologies and methods are widely used and well established; however, they suffer from multiple limitations, particularly with respect to storage density, durability, and energy efficiency \cite{Doricchi2022}. These aspects are fundamentally interdependent: pushing density tends to reduce physical noise margins, which requires additional redundancy and maintenance to preserve reliability, thereby increasing energy and operational overhead. Notably, the limited operational lifespan of these media leads to frequent data transfers and migration, resulting in additional costs, increased system complexity, and higher risks of data loss during transfer and maintenance operations.

In this context, the limitations of electronic and magnetic storage media have motivated research into alternative data storage technologies. Consequently research has increasingly focused on fundamentally different storage paradigms
that aim to overcome the physical and operational constraints of conventional media."

          "content": "Molecular data storage emerged as a promising approach to address long term data preservation challenges, while DNA based systems receiving the most attention to date.

Molecular storage media allow information to be stored without requiring a continuous energy supply, enabling data to remain preserved even in the absence of active hardware \cite{Jo2024}. Among molecular storage approaches, DNA based systems have received the most attention, as DNA sequences reliably encode biological information and can remain stable for long periods under suitable storage conditions \cite{Dong2020, Imburgia2025}. In addition, DNA based storage benefits from decades of progress in synthesis and sequencing technologies, which provide a relatively mature and well understood technological basis \cite{Buko2023,Wang2024} . A further key advantage of molecular storage lies in its exceptionally high storage density, which can exceed that of electronic and magnetic storage media by several orders of magnitude \cite{Jo2024,Imburgia2025} .

DNA based storage have demonstrated that digital information can be encoded, stored, and retrieved using molecular substrates in a reliable way, even under experimental conditions that require the use of error correction and redundancy mechanisms. As a result, DNA based storage has become the reference point for molecular data storage research.



However, DNA is not the only biological polymer capable of representing digital information. Alternatively, peptides, which consist of sequences of amino acids, represent one such molecular storage medium \cite{Ng2021}. In contrast to DNA, peptides can incorporate a substantially larger set of chemically distinct monomers because their synthesis and sequencing do not rely on enzyme recognition processes \cite{Ng2021}. This larger effective symbol alphabet can increase flexibility in data encoding. From an information theoretic perspective, a larger alphabet can increase the amount of information encoded per symbol; however, the achievable gains depend critically on how encoding schemes interact with substrate specific noise and readout uncertainty. In addition, peptide synthesis and analysis are supported by established techniques originating from proteomics research, where high throughput workflows are already widely employed \cite{Ng2021}. In particular, mass spectrometry based readout introduces measurement characteristics that differ fundamentally from DNA sequencing, as information is inferred from mass to charge distributions rather than discrete base identification.

In contrast to DNA storage, encoding strategies for peptide based systems remain comparatively underexplored, which limits the understanding of how existing molecular encoding principles perform when applied to peptide substrates \cite{Ng2021}.
Addressing these gaps is essential for understanding the potential and limitations of peptide based data storage."

          "content": "This thesis aims to examine whether encoding approaches developed for molecular data storage can be transferred to peptide sequences, in other words, whether the underlying design principles remain applicable when the molecular substrate and sequence alphabet change.

Can coding schemes originally developed for DNA based data storage, such as Huffman coding, DNA Fountain, and Yin-Yang coding, be applied to peptide sequences without requiring fundamental changes? In this thesis, “fundamental changes” refers to redesigning the core logic of a scheme; only minimal adaptations are considered, such as adjusting the alphabet mapping, parameter settings, and constraint handling to match peptide sequence properties.

This work focuses on computational evaluation and does not include experimental wet-lab validation. The goal is to provide a structured assessment of the transferability and limitations of DNA based coding schemes when applied to peptide sequences, using implementation based experiments and quantitative metrics (e.g., encoding overhead and decoding reliability under modeled errors) to identify where direct transfer is feasible and where peptide specific modifications become necessary.
To contextualize our research question, the following section summarizes existing work on molecular data storage and encoding schemes relevant to this thesis."

This thesis investigates whether encoding strategies developed for DNA-based molecular data storage can be transferred to peptide-based storage. To enable a controlled comparison, a software evaluation pipeline is implemented that (i) encodes digital files into fixed-length peptide sequences over a restricted amino-acid alphabet, (ii) applies an amino-acid-level channel model, and (iii) decodes the perturbed sequences to assess end-to-end reconstruction reliability. The pipeline is modular, enabling different encoding schemes to be evaluated within the same framework. \\begin{figure}[H]\\centering  \\scalebox{0.75}{\\input{Sources/pipline}} \\caption{Overview of the evaluation pipeline.} \\label{fig:method_pipeline_overview} \\end{figure}",

              "content": "\\label{sec:method_objective_scope} The objective is to evaluate, in a peptide setting, encoding schemes that are widely used in DNA storage and to quantify their robustness under residue-level perturbations. Three scheme families are considered: a Huffman-based baseline, a Fountain-code-based scheme, and a Yin--Yang-style constrained scheme. Each scheme produces a peptide sequence representation of the input; decoding performance is then quantified using the metrics defined in this chapter. The evaluation is conducted in software and focuses on coding and decoding behavior under a defined stochastic channel model.

\\paragraph{Varied factors.} 
\\begin{itemize} 
\\item \\textbf{Encoding scheme:} Multiple encoding schemes are compared under a shared pipeline backbone. 


\\item \\textbf{Outer redundancy configuration:} 
Redundancy is varied as an experimental factor, but its realization is scheme-dependent. 
For RS-protected configurations (e.g., Yin--Yang with an outer Reed--Solomon layer), redundancy is parameterized by the number of parity peptides $r$ added per block (e.g., $r \\in \\{8,16,32,64,128\\}$). 
For fountain-based configurations, redundancy is parameterized by an overhead factor $\\rho$, i.e., transmitting $(1+\\rho)$ encoded droplets relative to the $k_{\\mathrm{F}}$ source symbols. 
For each scheme, the corresponding redundancy parameter (either $r$ or $\\rho$) is swept while all remaining pipeline components and channel parameters are kept fixed, to quantify the redundancy--reliability trade-off under identical channel conditions.


\\item \\textbf{Input size:} Files spanning a wide size range (from bytes up to megabytes) are used to expose size-dependent failure behavior. 
\\end{itemize}


\\paragraph{Controlled factors.}
\\label{sec:method_factors}
The following factors are kept fixed across all experiments unless stated otherwise:
\\begin{itemize}
  \\item \\textbf{Peptide alphabet and mapping interface:} A restricted peptide alphabet $\\Sigma$ with $|\\Sigma|=8$ is used
  throughout, corresponding to $\\log_2|\\Sigma|=3$ bits of symbol capacity per residue.

  \\item \\textbf{Peptide length and framing:} Peptides have a fixed length $L$ (default $L=18$). An optional index prefix
  may be enabled, which reduces payload capacity accordingly.

  \\item \\textbf{Evaluation criteria:} The same end-to-end success criterion and the same evaluation metrics are applied
  to all schemes.
\\end{itemize}

\\paragraph{Channel settings (evaluation scenarios).}
Two fixed channel parameterizations are evaluated:
\\begin{itemize}
  \\item \\textbf{Uniform (sequence-agnostic) channel:} a stress-test setting with sequence-independent error behavior.
  \\item \\textbf{Score-driven (sequence-aware) channel:} a setting in which per-peptide error rates depend on predicted
  sequence quality (Section~\\ref{sec:method_error_model}).
\\end{itemize}
All cross-scheme comparisons are interpreted \\emph{within} the same channel setting. The uniform setting is used to
establish a conservative reference point, while the score-driven setting is used for the main comparisons.


\\paragraph{Success criterion.}
\\label{sec:method_success_criterion}
A run is considered successful if the reconstructed byte sequence matches the original input exactly. Let
$\\mathbf{x}$ denote the original byte sequence and $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ the decoded output. Success is defined as:
\\[
\\mathrm{success} = \\mathbf{1}\\!\\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{x}\\right].
\\]
No additional checksum layer is used in the RS-protected pipelines; therefore correctness is evaluated solely by
end-to-end equality of bytes. The Fountain configuration includes a per-droplet cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that
is used only to discard corrupted droplets (treating them as erasures); end-to-end correctness is still evaluated
by byte equality.

\\paragraph{Evaluation assumptions.}
\\label{sec:method_assumptions}
The evaluation makes simplifying assumptions that follow from the implemented pipeline:
\\begin{itemize}
  \\item \\textbf{Metadata is available to the decoder.} Parameters required for decoding (e.g., block structure,
  padding information, and optional indexing settings) are assumed to be known during decoding. The current pipeline
  does not embed this metadata into peptide payloads.

  \\item \\textbf{One observation per peptide.} Each peptide is evaluated as a single observed sequence after corruption.
  The pipeline does not simulate multiple reads, confidence scores, or consensus calling.

  \\item \\textbf{Stochastic channel without fixed seeding by default.} Error application is randomized; no fixed seeding
  strategy is used unless explicitly enabled for debugging or replication.
\\end{itemize}
